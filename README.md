Hi, I’m Martyn

I’m interested in all areas of development and have a particular passion for back-end development.

Having been made redundant from my previous role due to the COVID pandemic, I’m currently focused on professional development and undertaking as many training courses as possible as a full time student from home. I am actively looking for a position at Junior level at an organisation that will nurture my development and assist me in enhancing my knowledge and skills. 

For contact, collaboration, and anything else, please reach me through my LinkedIn profile at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martyn-minker/
