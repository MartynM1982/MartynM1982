My interests in development first spiked around 3 years ago when I was involved in redeveloping the website of the company I was working for. Since then I have made it my mission to learn as much as I can. 

Having been made redundant from my previous role due to the COVID pandemic, Iâ€™m currently a full time student focused on professional development through self-taught and distant learning. I am actively looking for a position at Junior level at an organisation that will nurture my development and assist me in enhancing my knowledge and skills. I'm a conscientious, ambitious, self-motivated, and hardworking professional with strong communication skills and an accurate and precise working style
