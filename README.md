Hi there,

My interests in development first spiked around 3 years ago when I was involved in redeveloping the website of the company I was working for. Since then I have made it my mission to learn as much as I can. I’m interested in all technologies and have a particular passion for back-end development.

Having been made redundant from my previous role due to the COVID pandemic, I’m currently focused on professional development and undertaking as many training courses as possible as a full time student from home. I am actively looking for a position at Junior level at an organisation that will nurture my development and assist me in enhancing my knowledge and skills. I'm a conscientious, ambitious, self-motivated, and hardworking professional with strong communication skills and an accurate and precise working style
