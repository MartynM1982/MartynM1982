Hi, I’m Martyn

I’m interested in all areas of development and engineering and have a particular passion for back-end development.

Having been made redundant from my previous role due to the COVID pandemic, I’m currently learning as many skills as I can as a full time student from home. I would love to find a position at a Junior level. Somewhere that will nurture me and assist me in developing and enhancing my skills. 

For contact, collaboration, and anything else, please reach me through my LinkedIn profile at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martyn-minker/
